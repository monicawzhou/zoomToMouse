# zoomToMouse
[Live Demo](http://seafirefly.com/zoomToMouse/zoomToMouse.html)

Prompt:
Construct a Three.js scene with a variety of geometric primitives of different sizes and colors. Use the OrbitControls class from Three.js [1] to provide navigation around the scene by orbiting, panning and zooming. Note that the zooming works independently of where the mouse pointer is positioned inside the browser window - OrbitControls always zooms in and out using a point in the center of the window. Modify the OrbitControls class so that it zooms in to where the mouse pointer is located on the screen (this is how zooming in works in Blender, for example [2]).
